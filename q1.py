"""Write a program that performs the following tasks:

-	(10 points) Set the random seed to 2020 
-	(20 points) Randomly generate 10,000 numbers between 1000 and 2000 (inclusive) 
-	(50 points) Find all numbers that are 
o	even numbers and 
o	can be divided by 7 
-	(50 points) Count the frequency of the above numbers. Tips: you may want to use a dictionary.
-	(20 points) Display the numbers in ascending order and their frequencies as the following (sample output showing the format, not the real result):

1008 17
1022 19
1036 15
